Jean - Landing Page Template = Documentation

Getting Started

Thanks for buying  our theme. 
We put a lot of work into our designs, 
and our adobe Muse themes are no exception. 
Our team spends days making sure that every little deal is perfect. 
We wrote a short guide to get you started with your new Muse Theme, 
but if you have any problems just mail me : master002@live.in

Luckily everything in Muse is pretty simple -
 to start just go into your downloaded folder Called 
“Jean - Landing Page Template” and open the file called “Jean.muse” 
(this will open straight into Adobe Muse.) We included some other files too, 
which you can find in the “assets” folder. Once you’re inside that folder 
you’ll find a lot more folders with names matching what’s inside them.
Once you get Muse opened you’ll want to head over to the “Design” tab - 
Then Open the “Home” page. In “Design” you can edit all of the bits you 
see once the site has been published.

PS. To be able to edit everything on the page you should 
right-click and select “Unlock All on Page”, and to add 
metadata like Keywords, page description etc. you’ll 
need to right-click and select “Page Properties”.
